I'm a Milwaukee-based data analyst who has spent the past 8 years working in data journalism, business intelligence and marketing analytics. In these roles, I've used a wide variety of tools and programming languages to process, analyze and tell stories with data. Since May 2020, I've been enrolled full-time in a Master's in Data Science program through Indiana University. Check out the below pages to see some of my past work. Please <a href="https://www.walkermoskop.com/contact/">send me a note</a> or a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/walkermoskop/">LinkedIn message</a> if you'd like to get in touch.
