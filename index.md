I'm a Milwaukee-based data analyst who has spent the past 8 years working in data journalism, business intelligence and marketing analytics. In these roles, I've used a wide variety of tools (mainly Python) to process, analyze and tell stories with data. Since May 2020, I've been enrolled full-time in a Master's in Data Science program through Indiana University. Check out the below pages to see some of my past work. Please <a href="https://walkermoskop.github.io/contact/">send an email</a> or a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/walkermoskop/">LinkedIn message</a> if you'd like to get in touch.

As a data analyst and journalist, I've used data, code and traditional reporting methods to find and tell stories on everything from money in politics to economic development to real estate speculation. Click here to see some of my work.
