# Skills
The vast majority of my work in recent years involves Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, QGIS and Excel. I've also used a variety of relational database managers, BI tools like SSIS, DAX and SSAS and have used JavaScript for data visualization (particularly for making maps). And while I have not written a line of it in a few years, my undergraduate CS coursework was all in C++.
